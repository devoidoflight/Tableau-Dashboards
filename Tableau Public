In this first dashboard, I connected Google BigQuery as a Datasource. That way, whenever I update my data it automatically updates the dashboard too. 
This way we can update our dashboards daily and see what happennd to our data in daily basis.

I created this one for a website. It's using the data from our paper. I didn't wanted to expose the data so i used the aggregated results.
